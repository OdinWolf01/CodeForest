hey  what  do you think of making a  voip  app  included  in our  chat
    not only  will you be  able  to video  stream  to each other  but you can call
    landlines  and  cell phones  as  well  i was looking at  sinch.js
    its  something that most socials  dont have
    make a phone call  from our  chat to a  land line  /  cell
    like  when the user  signs  up  not only  will they get a member id
    but  maybe  use  RAND  function in php  to generate  7 digit
    phone numbers  so each account  will have a  phone number attached to it
    database table  user_phone  or  something  lol
    this  will be  a  cool  feature  4  sure
    i mean if  magic  jack  can make calls to a  landline over the  web then so can we
    :)  tell  me  what you think

generate  thumbnails off the original uploaded image  
to be  shown in media recent codelet 
at the same time  resize the original image as well  
so that  original photo  shows in photo  albumn 
and thumbnails  gets  show in media recent codelet
